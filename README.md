# Advanced topic 2 : Version control tool (git)
For our second advanced topic we decided to use a version control tool both for the sake of learning an advanced subject as well as making the development of the project's code a lot easier. It allowed us to do the following:

## Make changes to the project asynchronously
While i was working on the code for one feature Misha could work on the other. When done we would commit the changes to the main branch. Despite the option for multiple branches in git, we never needed them that much.

## Keep track of features in each commit
All commits made to the project have a small description and note the user who made them so we know what is added and by whom. Allowing us to clearly see who is responsible for implementing which features, this means that we know who to ask for explanation on how or why something works (if it doesn't).

## Easy backups
Because all code was on github, my device and misha's device. We had multiple backups in case data got corrupted. We could also roll back to previous versions in case an update breaks the application. (Which i had to do after messing the project once, resulting in me re-pulling from git)
